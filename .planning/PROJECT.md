# Into the Void

## What This Is

A multiplayer 2D sci-fi survival MMO with procedural world generation. Players join factions, explore zones with biome-specific hazards, interact with entities, and engage in combat. The game features real-time multiplayer sync, client-side prediction, and a complete auth-to-gameplay flow.

## Current State (v1.1 shipped)

**Shipped features:**
- Authentication: Register, login, JWT tokens
- Character management: Select, create characters with faction selection
- WebSocket game connection with auth handshake
- World rendering with 16 biome tile types and viewport culling
- Movement: WASD keyboard + click-to-move A* pathfinding
- Client-side prediction with server reconciliation
- Entity rendering with health bars and behavior icons
- HUD: Health, energy, XP bars + zone name + minimap

**Tech stack:**
- Frontend: React 18, Phaser 3, Zustand, React Router v7
- Backend: NestJS (API + WebSocket game server)
- Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- Monorepo: NX with 3 apps + 4 shared packages

**Codebase:** ~9,120 LOC TypeScript

## Current Milestone: v1.8 Entity System

**Goal:** Implement entity definition system with spawning, interaction, and loot. Entities include creatures (idle wander), plants, minerals, and artifacts — all interactable via tools with range-based interaction.

**Target features:**
- Entity definition system (strategy pattern, repository) matching items/tiles pattern
- 4 entity types: Creatures, Plants, Minerals, Artifacts with type hierarchy
- ~35 entity definitions (~10 creatures, ~10 plants, ~10 minerals, ~5 artifacts)
- Fertility noise layer determining spawn density (Barren/Normal/Lush)
- Biome-specific entity spawning with 0-5 entities per chunk
- Entity stats (level-based, reusing CharacterStats)
- Health bars for all entities
- Weighted random loot drop tables
- Tool interaction with range stat (1-10 tiles)
- Perception/level gating (shows "???" if insufficient)
- Creature idle wander behavior
- Entity respawn with random timer ranges
- Zone HUD shows fertility: "Biome Name (Fertility)"

## Core Value

Real-time multiplayer gameplay with responsive movement and visual feedback.

### Active

- [ ] Entity definition system with strategy pattern and repository
- [ ] 4 entity types with type hierarchy (Creatures, Plants, Minerals, Artifacts)
- [ ] Fertility noise layer (Barren/Normal/Lush spawn density)
- [ ] Biome-specific entity spawning (0-5 per chunk)
- [ ] Entity stats and health bars
- [ ] Weighted random loot drop tables
- [ ] Tool interaction with range stat
- [ ] Perception/level gating for entities
- [ ] Creature idle wander behavior
- [ ] Entity respawn system
- [ ] Zone HUD fertility display

### Out of Scope

- OAuth/social login — email/password sufficient
- Sprite-based rendering — color tiles only until art pipeline ready
- Combat system — separate milestone (creatures attack, damage dealing)
- Chat system — separate milestone
- Sound/music — polish phase
- Mobile controls — web-first
- Tool abilities on action bar — future expansion
- Tool durability/consumption — future milestone

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: React for UI, Phaser for game canvas — established pattern
- **Styling**: Plain CSS with CSS variables — no framework
- **Sprites**: 96x96 pixel size — from CLAUDE.md
- **Factions**: Verdant Dynamics, Helix Extraction, Nexus Frontiers, Unaffiliated — from lore
- **Tile size**: 96px for all tiles and sprites

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| React screens (not Phaser menus) | Auth forms are standard web UI | ✓ Good |
| React Router v7 action pattern | Modern form handling | ✓ Good |
| Lore-correct factions | Match world-bible.md | ✓ Good |
| 5-second auth timeout | Prevents stuck connections | ✓ Good |
| E-XXXX error codes | User-facing errors with action hints | ✓ Good |
| Client-side prediction | Responsive movement feel | ✓ Good |
| 140ms server rate limit | Prevents movement spam | ✓ Good |
| Phaser multi-camera minimap | Reuses tile rendering | ✓ Good |
| 96px TILE_SIZE | Matches sprite specification | ✓ Good |
| pauseOnBlur enabled | Prevents memory leaks on tab switch | ✓ Good |

## Known Issues

- Adjacent chunk loading times out (server zone:request not implemented)
- WebSocket auth without handshake validation (guards on all handlers)
