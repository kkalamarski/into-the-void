# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-16)

**Core value:** Real-time multiplayer gameplay with responsive movement and visual feedback
**Current focus:** Phase 9 - Rendering Optimization & Interaction

## Current Position

Phase: 9 of 12 (Rendering Optimization & Interaction)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-16 — Completed 09-01-PLAN.md (Screen-Relative WASD Input Mapping)

Progress: [████████████░░░░░░░░] 67% (8 of 12 phases complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 30 (from v1.0, v1.1, and v1.2)
- Average duration: 3m 58s per plan
- Total execution time: ~1.99 hours

**By Milestone:**

| Milestone | Phases | Plans | Timeline |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|
| v1.0 Auth & Character Screens | 1-3 | 7 | 2026-02-13 → 2026-02-14 |
| v1.1 Post-Login Game Experience | 4-7 | 20 | 2026-02-14 → 2026-02-16 |
| v1.2 Isometric View | 8-12 | 4 | 2026-02-16 → In progress |

**Recent Trend:**
- v1.0: 2 days (7 plans)
- v1.1: 3 days (20 plans)
- v1.2: In progress (4 plans, Phase 8 complete, Phase 9 in progress)
- Trend: Stable velocity, good parallelization

**Recent Plans:**

| Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| Phase 08 P01 | 73s | 2 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 08 P02 | 4m 44s | 2 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 08 P03 | 7m 48s | 3 tasks | 3 files |
| Phase 09 P01 | 70 | 1 tasks | 1 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Key decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v1.1: Client-side prediction with server reconciliation
- v1.1: Phaser multi-camera minimap reuses tile rendering
- v1.1: 96px TILE_SIZE matches sprite specification
- v1.1: pauseOnBlur prevents memory leaks on tab switch
- [Phase 08]: Use 128x64 tile size (2:1 isometric ratio) with centered origin (0.5, 0.5)
- [Phase 08]: Entity elevation 12px, blob shadow 40x20 ellipse, depth update throttle 100ms
- [Phase 08]: Polygon-based tile rendering (diamond graphics until isometric sprites available)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 8 (Planning):**
- Phaser upgrade from 3.80.0 to 3.90.0 may have breaking changes
- Coordinate transformation accuracy needs validation at map edges
- Depth sorting performance with 200+ entities needs profiling

**Known Issues from v1.1:**
- Adjacent chunk loading times out (server zone:request not implemented)
- WebSocket auth without handshake validation (guards on all handlers)

## Session Continuity
